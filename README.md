# muxt, a keyboard-only music player

## design goals:
- lightweight - should be able to be ran on a computer doing intensive tasks (such as playing video games) without noticeably affecting performance
- customizability - users should be able to easily make custom aliases, keybinds and whatnot
- powerful - users should be able to find and play music in a powerful dynamically-parsed manner
- efficient - frequent actions should be able to be executed in minimal keystrokes
- keyboard oriented - users should be able to easily and intuitively do everything using just the keyboard

## non-goals
