![AGPL3_logo](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/agplv3-with-text-162x68.png)

A music player intended to allow you to easily queue specific tracks without having to do a lot of searching, and with advanced filtering and grouping options

## design goals

- lightweight - should be able to be ran on a computer doing intensive tasks (such as playing video games) without noticeably affecting performance
- customizability - users should be able to easily make custom aliases, keybinds and whatnot
- powerful - users should be able to find and play music in a powerful dynamically-parsed manner
- efficient - frequent actions should be able to be executed in minimal keystrokes
- keyboard oriented - users should be able to easily and intuitively do everything using just the keyboard


upcoming: 
    an equalizer and other mixing features
